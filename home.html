			<i> I am a current Computer Science student <br> studying
		 		at Arizona State University. My CS classes so far have included <br>
		 		CSE 110, 120, 205, and 240; respectively, Intro to Programming
		 		With Java, <br> Digital Design Fundamentals, Object-Oriented 
		 		Programming and Data Structures, and Intro to Different <br>
		 		Programming Languages. In my free time I have taken
		 		an interest in web and iOS development. <br> I am currently
		 		working on a personal project that should hit the App Store
		 		very soon! You can find it in my projects <br> page. I also
		 		have various other personal projects, assignments, and homework
		 		listed there with GitHub <br> repositories for each. I encourage
		 		you to check them out and let me know what you think! <br>
		 		Thank you for visiting my site!</i></p>
