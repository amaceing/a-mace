			<i> I am a current Computer Science student <br> studying
		 		at Arizona State University. My CS classes so far have included <br>
		 		CSE 110, 120, 230, 205, and 240; Intro to Programming
		 		With Java, Digital<br>Design Fundamentals, Assembly Language, Object-Oriented 
		 		Programming and Data Structures, <br> and Intro to Different

		 		working on a personal project that should hit the App Store
		 		very soon! You can find it <br> in my projects page. I also
		 		have various other personal projects, assignments, and <br> homework
		 		listed there with GitHub repositories for each. <br><br>I encourage
